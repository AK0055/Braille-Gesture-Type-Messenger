# Braille-Gesture-Type-Messenger
The ease of communication with smart phones is for all kinds of people. Without a doubt, blind people deserve instant messaging in smartphones with no complexity. Gesture typing, vibration and Audio all three make a powerful combination to get input from the blind user and give output in an understandable way.
To make blind peopleâ€™s social lives easier, this project aims at making an android app and a website for SMS messaging that uses braille concept, using over 30+ gestures for typing alphabets, special characters and numbers and also spacing, newline features just by swiping in various patterns in the app. They also experience vibration of different levels and a voice output to verify what they typed is correct.
